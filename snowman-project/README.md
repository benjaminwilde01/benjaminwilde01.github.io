## Overview

For project #1, I made a game of Snowman(otherwise known as Hangman).

When a user goes to the site, they are greeted with a message welcoming them to the game and explaining the rules.

They are then prompted to press the 'start' button.

Once they press the 'start' button, the alphabet buttons appear along with the blanked out secret word they are to guess.

Now they are given 6 incorrect guesses and with each incorrect guess the counter decrements and with each correct guess the chosen letter is displayed.

If they run out of guesses, then a message pops up telling them they have lost and are given the opportunity to play again. If they choose to play again the page reloads and the game starts over.

If they correctly guess the word, then a message pops up telling them they have won and are given the opportunity to play again. If they choose to play again the page reloads and the game starts over.


## Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Future Development:
- Add a timer that limits time between guesses
- Keep track of wins and losses
